### EV Calculator
This is a calculator that automatically calculates your weekly mileage input into an annual estimate providing calculation of the amount of CO2 used and price of fuel from the provided data.
Some of the features are:
- Supports 3 different types of Vehicles.
- Calculates your total usage, CO2, Miles and cost.
- Supports offline use if your browser supports service workers

### Description 

There are different ways to create an EV caculator either with full input form or with available cost data as provided with this project.

I used switch statements in my calculations as it's more efficient for me to work with, it also helped since we have data provided to use as a switch statement would just pick one of the options based on the selection.

There are notes above the caclculations used in utilities.js to work out this app.

AnimatedNumber has been imported from React just to provide a "cool" way of showing the result.

All colors used have just been assumed a fit to the current  website and everything can be modified if required.
